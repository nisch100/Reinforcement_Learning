# Project 3: Collaboration and Competition

### Introduction

The involves implementing Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in a [Tennis](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#tennis) environment.

![Trained Agent][image1]

In this environment, two agents control rackets to bounce a ball over a net. If an agent hits the ball over the net, it receives a reward of +0.1.  If an agent lets a ball hit the ground or hits the ball out of bounds, it receives a reward of -0.01.  Thus, the goal of each agent is to keep the ball in play.

The observation space consists of 8 variables corresponding to the position and velocity of the ball and racket. Each agent receives its own, local observation.  Two continuous actions are available, corresponding to movement toward (or away from) the net, and jumping. 

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agents must get an average score of +0.5 (over 100 consecutive episodes, after taking the maximum over both agents). Specifically,

- After each episode, we add up the rewards that each agent received (without discounting), to get a score for each agent. This yields 2 (potentially different) scores. We then take the maximum of these 2 scores.
- This yields a single **score** for each episode.

The ebvironment can initially be a little slow while training. However it tends to pick up after 200 episodes thus attaining an average score of **0.5** at around 400 episodes


**Files Breakdown**

1.)model.py -> Contains the defined Architecture for the Actor and Critic networks\
2.)ddpg.py -> The file contains the algorithm which is built off of Replay buffer method\
3.)Continuous_Control.ipynb -> The notebook contains the information required to train the model using the above two files\
4.)Continuous_Control_Report.ipynb -> Includes a jupyter writeup on what each segment of the code is doing\
5.)Actor_final.pth -> Stores the weights for the actor network that were tunes as the agent learned\
6.)Critic_final.pth -> Stores the weights for the critic network that were tunes as the agent learned\

### Getting Started

1. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:
    - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis_Linux.zip)
    - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis.app.zip)
    - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis_Windows_x86.zip)
    - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis_Windows_x86_64.zip)
    
    (_For Windows users_) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

2. Place the file in a convenient location on your computer enbaling you to invoke the environment. Tennis.ipynb walks you through how this can be achieved 

### Instructions

Follow the instructions in `Tennis.ipynb` to get started with training your own agent! Additionally to get a documentation on how the code is run and the architecture being used, refer to Tennis_Report.ipynb
